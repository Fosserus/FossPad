## FossPad - a simple text editor written in wxWidgets


This is one of my first ever GUI projects I've ever made, so please excuse the 
crudeness of the UI. As you may know, writing a GUI in C++ has been notoriously
difficult to do, especially with the plethora of GUI libraries such as GTK, QT,
and the confusing nature of WinAPI. 

### What is FossPad?

Basically, it's a text editor. 'Nuff said. It's the most barebones text editor
you'll ever see. It's not Notepad++, it's not Kate, nor is it close to
gEdit. It's moreso closer to Notepad from the Windows 9x - Windows XP era,
except with less features (maybe.)

### When will this project be finished?

I'm hoping that I can get this project done by the end of the month, but
as I'm still learning the ropes of wxWidgets, it may take a little bit to get
the hang of it. I'm confident that I can get it done though!
